# Bash For Windows

Bash for Windows has been a big project. It is pretty self explanitory what it is: it tries to act like bash on versions of 
Windows that don't have it avaliable through the linux subsystem (e.g. Windows XP, 7, 8, etc.). If you are running an os that 
can run the real Bash, though, use that. This script is not the best at doing it's job, though it is getting better.
